This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/FOOD#PRICES____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.____/FOOD#QUALITY/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.____/FOOD#QUALITY____

The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).____/FOOD#QUALITY____/SERVICE#GENERAL
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY

After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.________
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.____/FOOD#QUALITY/FOOD#PRICES____/FOOD#QUALITY
The level of rudeness was preposterous.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL/DRINKS#QUALITY
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.________/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.________/RESTAURANT#GENERAL

I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/DRINKS#QUALITY
Moving on.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/DRINKS#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
Well...they can run but they can't hide.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.____/FOOD#QUALITY____
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.____/FOOD#QUALITY____
However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
This place...god where do i begin.____/FOOD#QUALITY____
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.____/FOOD#QUALITY/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
Great Hot Dogs!____/FOOD#QUALITY/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!____/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS____/FOOD#QUALITY
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
We live nearby BFC.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years.____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/FOOD#PRICES
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL/FOOD#PRICES____/SERVICE#GENERAL
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL/SERVICE#GENERAL
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.____/FOOD#PRICES____/FOOD#QUALITY
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL/FOOD#PRICES
So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My family ate here last weekend.____/RESTAURANT#PRICES____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.____/SERVICE#GENERAL/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS____/FOOD#QUALITY/DRINKS#QUALITY
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL/AMBIENCE#GENERAL
If you go here, do it on his off-night.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
Best meal in a long time!____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.____/SERVICE#GENERAL/RESTAURANT#PRICES____
My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL

Highly recommend it!____/DRINKS#QUALITY____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
Great Atmosphere____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY

Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.____/FOOD#QUALITY/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
Appetizers took nearly an hour.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/FOOD#PRICES
Never got an explanation as to what was going on.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#PRICES____/SERVICE#GENERAL
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____
What a hassle!____/FOOD#QUALITY____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The food is very good, but not outstanding.____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL/DRINKS#QUALITY
Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Expensive____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
I went there after hearing how great it was.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Wow.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/FOOD#PRICES
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.____/SERVICE#GENERAL/RESTAURANT#PRICES____/FOOD#QUALITY

The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.____/RESTAURANT#PRICES____
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.____/RESTAURANT#PRICES____/SERVICE#GENERAL
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."____/RESTAURANT#PRICES____/SERVICE#GENERAL
What?____/FOOD#QUALITY/FOOD#PRICES____/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/SERVICE#GENERAL
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.____/FOOD#QUALITY____/AMBIENCE#GENERAL

I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/SERVICE#GENERAL
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/FOOD#QUALITY/RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.____/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS____/SERVICE#GENERAL
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.____/SERVICE#GENERAL____/SERVICE#GENERAL/RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
