Red Dragon Roll - my favorite thing to eat, of any food group - hands down FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Just go to Yamato and order the Red Dragon Roll.

Favorite Sushi in NYC
I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite. FOOD#QUALITY

Come on.
Don't get me started on the margaritas, either. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.
Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Save your money and your time and go somewhere else. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.

This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York. RESTAURANT#GENERAL RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected. FOOD#QUALITY
All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.

Good Experience
During our trip to NYC, we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu (offering a modified menu for $65 pp). FOOD#PRICES
The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings. SERVICE#GENERAL DRINKS#QUALITY
The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing. FOOD#QUALITY
However, our main course was wonderful. RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES
I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations. FOOD#QUALITY
The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost. SERVICE#GENERAL
Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location. FOOD#PRICES LOCATION#GENERAL
All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future. SERVICE#GENERAL
The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order. SERVICE#GENERAL
The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy. FOOD#QUALITY
over.
Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.

Maggot in the food! FOOD#QUALITY
I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table. FOOD#QUALITY
The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom. FOOD#QUALITY
I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for). SERVICE#GENERAL
When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach. FOOD#QUALITY
The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession. FOOD#QUALITY
We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food. FOOD#QUALITY
For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL

Indo Chinese food, pretty good... FOOD#QUALITY
Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken. FOOD#QUALITY
My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily. FOOD#QUALITY
Still we keep going back :) RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I was speechless by the horrible food. FOOD#QUALITY
I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish. FOOD#QUALITY
Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation). FOOD#QUALITY
I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
This place survives on reputation alone. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I will NEVER return. RESTAURANT#GENERAL

But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine? FOOD#PRICES
Are you freaking kidding me?
Look, the appetizers were really good. FOOD#QUALITY
The entree was also very good.
Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
What you are paying for is the environment and the name. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while. AMBIENCE#GENERAL
$500 included: FOOD#PRICES
Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each. FOOD#PRICES
Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi.

Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.
Vanison was good but not amazing. FOOD#QUALITY
Bison was quite excellent however. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Dessert: pure disaster.
Just not good at all.
Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I was wrong. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant". SERVICE#GENERAL
I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it. FOOD#QUALITY
All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts). FOOD#QUALITY
The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.

Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience! FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
BUT not in a good way.
I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited. SERVICE#GENERAL

For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink. SERVICE#GENERAL
We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka. SERVICE#GENERAL
After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner. SERVICE#GENERAL
We asked for beverages and never received them.
We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I would not expect this for a $55 dinner. FOOD#PRICES
By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant. RESTAURANT#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers! FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money. RESTAURANT#GENERAL

I went here for a family birthday dinner. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening. SERVICE#GENERAL
The hostess said "Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which I replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please." SERVICE#GENERAL
At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us. SERVICE#GENERAL RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.
There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. SERVICE#GENERAL
Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma.
The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). FOOD#QUALITY
The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless. FOOD#QUALITY
I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. FOOD#QUALITY
After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member.
The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order. SERVICE#GENERAL
We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay. RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL
She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. SERVICE#GENERAL

Great Indian food FOOD#QUALITY
I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had. FOOD#QUALITY
Very "normal Indian food", but done really well. FOOD#QUALITY
I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $. SERVICE#GENERAL
I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price). RESTAURANT#PRICES
But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food SERVICE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES

Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it. SERVICE#GENERAL
The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
We go often for lunch and the place is packed. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given. RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL
Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Wretched and retching
This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant. RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL
I have never been so disgusted by both food an service. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
For starters they delivered us someone else's order. RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Fine, I wont hang you for that.
However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin. FOOD#QUALITY
Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation. FOOD#QUALITY AMBIENCE#GENERAL
None was made so i hung up.
Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!
We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.
It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Eat at your own risk.
Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner AMBIENCE#GENERAL
I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night. FOOD#QUALITY
I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing! FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
More Williamsburg Garbage
My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight. FOOD#QUALITY
We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.
The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.
Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl. FOOD#PRICES
The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted. FOOD#QUALITY
The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean. FOOD#QUALITY
The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request. FOOD#QUALITY
The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service. SERVICE#GENERAL
I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
She just nodded and walked off. FOOD#QUALITY
There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.
As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made. FOOD#QUALITY
My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
We were charged full price. FOOD#QUALITY
If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village. FOOD#QUALITY
Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
Lives up to the hype RESTAURANT#GENERAL
We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there. SERVICE#GENERAL
We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations. SERVICE#GENERAL
It was well worth the wait. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The wife had the risotto which was amazing. FOOD#QUALITY
It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty. FOOD#PRICES
Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
A quintessential slice of NYC pizza. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components. FOOD#QUALITY AMBIENCE#GENERAL
Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good. FOOD#QUALITY
Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake! SERVICE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES DRINKS#QUALITY
I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it. AMBIENCE#GENERAL
We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better. FOOD#QUALITY
The entrees were served with miso soup and rice. FOOD#QUALITY
For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.
Terrible would be a compliment! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night. FOOD#QUALITY AMBIENCE#GENERAL
We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!! FOOD#QUALITY
We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread! SERVICE#GENERAL DRINKS#QUALITY
Stay away RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Great Shabu Shabu
I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold! FOOD#QUALITY
I love it. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi. SERVICE#GENERAL
The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
Restaurant with a view RESTAURANT#GENERAL LOCATION#GENERAL
Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
The food tasted very good. FOOD#QUALITY
The family seafood entree was very good.
The main entree was also very good.
We order a bit of everything on the menu. FOOD#QUALITY
Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
This place doesn't make any sense RESTAURANT#GENERAL RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money. SERVICE#GENERAL RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional... AMBIENCE#GENERAL
This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird. FOOD#QUALITY
The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked. FOOD#QUALITY
Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Good Food FOOD#QUALITY
I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary.
The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner. FOOD#QUALITY
Over all it was a very nice romantic place . AMBIENCE#GENERAL
I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible) RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Loved it
A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it. RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL
The atmosphere was great. AMBIENCE#GENERAL
The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about. RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
Maybe it has improved since then?
Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Dumbfoundingly Poor
This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn. LOCATION#GENERAL
The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
Polite acknowledgement is out; RESTAURANT#GENERAL
supercilious scorn is in.
And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent? RESTAURANT#GENERAL
A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest. FOOD#QUALITY
The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins) RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture. SERVICE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES
On that scale, it's a world-beater.
How is this palce still open? FOOD#QUALITY
I honestly don't even know where to begin. SERVICE#GENERAL
My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms. FOOD#QUALITY
We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon. FOOD#QUALITY
Everything was going good until we got our meals. FOOD#QUALITY
I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat. FOOD#QUALITY
I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away. SERVICE#GENERAL
So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it. FOOD#QUALITY
I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!! FOOD#QUALITY
So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!! FOOD#QUALITY
I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.
This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!! FOOD#QUALITY
We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore. FOOD#QUALITY
The level of rudeness was preposterous.
The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out. SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL DRINKS#QUALITY
I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE. RESTAURANT#GENERAL

I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL DRINKS#QUALITY
Moving on.
If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian. FOOD#QUALITY
The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
Well...they can run but they can't hide.
I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.
Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant. AMBIENCE#GENERAL
This place...god where do i begin.
It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!! AMBIENCE#GENERAL
How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me. FOOD#QUALITY
Great Hot Dogs! FOOD#QUALITY
I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).
Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food. RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing! FOOD#QUALITY
Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu. FOOD#QUALITY
But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
We live nearby BFC.
It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. SERVICE#GENERAL
As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later! SERVICE#GENERAL
The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. FOOD#QUALITY
I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF?? FOOD#QUALITY
I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely! RESTAURANT#GENERAL SERVICE#GENERAL
There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. SERVICE#GENERAL
Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee. FOOD#QUALITY
Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES
So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first... FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
Maitre-D-"Eat and get out" RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My family ate here last weekend. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert. FOOD#QUALITY DRINKS#QUALITY
This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else. SERVICE#GENERAL AMBIENCE#GENERAL
If you go here, do it on his off-night.
Best meal in a long time! FOOD#QUALITY
Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening. FOOD#QUALITY
I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish. FOOD#QUALITY
The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The food is great and the environment is even better. FOOD#QUALITY
Everyone must come here at least once.
Highly recommend it! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Taking Hot Dogs to the next level RESTAURANT#GENERAL
At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available. FOOD#QUALITY
Great Atmosphere
Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal. FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok. FOOD#QUALITY

Poor service and management SERVICE#GENERAL
Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner. FOOD#QUALITY
Appetizers took nearly an hour.
When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL FOOD#PRICES
Never got an explanation as to what was going on. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly. SERVICE#GENERAL
When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
What a hassle! RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The food is very good, but not outstanding. FOOD#QUALITY
There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table. SERVICE#GENERAL
On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL DRINKS#QUALITY
Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Expensive
I went there after hearing how great it was. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Wow.
The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty. FOOD#QUALITY FOOD#PRICES
The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor. FOOD#QUALITY
I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far. FOOD#QUALITY
So rude!!!
I went with JWILS. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
Her review is above.
I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience. RESTAURANT#GENERAL
My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.
The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us. SERVICE#GENERAL
The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane. SERVICE#GENERAL
I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party." SERVICE#GENERAL
What? RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were. SERVICE#GENERAL
We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem. AMBIENCE#GENERAL

But the service is HORRID! SERVICE#GENERAL
I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter. SERVICE#GENERAL
The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand. FOOD#QUALITY SERVICE#GENERAL
I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food! FOOD#QUALITY RESTAURANT#GENERAL
The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it). SERVICE#GENERAL
I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table. SERVICE#GENERAL
She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables. SERVICE#GENERAL
I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff. SERVICE#GENERAL RESTAURANT#MISCELLANEOUS
